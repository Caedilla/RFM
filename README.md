# RFM - Raeli's Frame Mods.
A bunch of personal UI tweaks.

## About
This is just a collection of small tweaks for my own UI setup. It does the following and more:
* skins the chat frames with a simple 1px black border and solid semi-transparent background
* toggles SorhaQuestLog's Quest Tracker on and off in raids
* automatically accepts group finder role selection pop ups.
* sets a whole bunch of CVars - mostly graphics settings, as they have been resetting often since 8.0
* slightly resizes Bagnon to better fit in my UI
* moves Grid2 to be above ChatFrame1 - I found Grid2 has a tendancy to move out of place over several sessions for some reason. This stops that.
